# validbit's Unexpected layouts

Just a few layouts (stripped of personal and tagging/expanding) that I gradually edited until they became my daily driver. Enjoy and keep on learning! 

## Usage/Examples
Copy contents of .xml file into a input field, shown when choosing `Custom` layout in [Unexpected keyboard](https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard/).
